# CatsOnSwiftUI
##Application requirements
The application should use the The Cat API to display pictures and information about a user selected cat breed
At a minimum the app should contain the following:
* An interface to allow the user to select their desired cat breed
* A list displaying cat pictures of the chosen cat breed


##  Stretch Goals
* Display information about the chosen cat breed
* Paginate the displayed list
* Network results are cached in memory
* UI changes are animated


##  Application notes
* The UI design of the app is up to you (pst, we love to see a slickly designed UI)
* The app should be architected in such a way that it's simple to add further selection criteria
* Testing is encouraged but not required, at a minimum the code should be architected in such a way that adding tests is simple
* Show off any architecture patterns you particularly like to use
